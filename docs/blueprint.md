## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep, saturated violet (#794BC4) to evoke the innovative spirit of blockchain, while remaining clearly legible.
- Background color: Very light, desaturated violet (#F2F0F7), near white but harmonizing with the primary.
- Accent color: Saturated, vibrant fuchsia (#E91E63) for interactive elements and important highlights; contrasts clearly with both primary and background.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for a clean, modern, neutral presentation.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent lpTokens and related data.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout to present the data in a structured and easy-to-understand manner.
